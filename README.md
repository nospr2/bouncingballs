# Bouncing Balls
Creating a video that has bouncing balls

Here's a basic outline for how you can write a Python script to produce the video you described:

    Import the necessary libraries: You will need to import libraries for generating graphics (such as Pygame), handling audio (such as Pygame), and for writing the final video output to a file (such as moviepy).

    Create the ball objects: Define a class for representing the balls that bounce around the screen. Each ball should have a position, velocity, size, and color. You can use Pygame's built-in drawing functions to draw the balls on the screen.

    Define the audio components: Create a sound effect for each ball and map it to a specific note or musical scale. Use Pygame's audio functions to play the sound effect when a ball hits a wall.

    Simulate the bouncing: Write a loop that updates the position and velocity of each ball based on its current position, velocity, and the walls of the screen. You can use simple physics equations to calculate the new velocity of each ball after it hits a wall.

    Render the video: In each iteration of the loop, draw the balls on the screen and play the appropriate sound effect for each ball that hits a wall. Use moviepy to write the final video output to a file in 720p at 60 frames per second.

    Save the video file: Finally, write the video output to a file in the desired format (e.g. MP4).

This is a rough outline of how you can implement the project, but there may be additional details and nuances that you need to consider, such as handling ball-ball collisions, adding user controls, etc.
